## How to contriute?
1. Fork the project.</br>
2. Raise an issue, so that we can know on what feature you are working on.</br>
3. Once the development is done, request PR for the same issue number and I will verify and merge the code.

## Guidance,
1. Make one separate html page for each page and link that HTML on main navigation menu inside <b>a</b> tag.</br>
2. Make sure you follow tha same design pattern throughout the website.</br>
3. Make sure to include <b>NAV</b> in all the html page.</br>
4. Make sure whatever you code is responsive for all screen sizes.</br>
5. For any improvement let it be this README file, raise an issue and then PR.
